# Python Dataset Viewer Prototype
## Summary
Protoype for viewing slices of n-D datasets. 
## Usage
Launching the program:
``` python Sliders.py ```

The protoype generates and plots a random 7D array. By default, the final two dimensions are selected as the X and Y axes for the starting view. Changing an axis selection can be done by unchecking one X/Y button and clicking another. Moving through the slices can be done by using the slidders or stepper. The sliders and steppers will not change unless both an X and Y dimension have been selected.
